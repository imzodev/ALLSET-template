I got my first computer when I was 8, an old MS DOS machine, and my first taste of web development was at 12, using Dreamweaver. In high school, I took a Visual Basic class, but I didn't really develop a passion for programming until I was in college, where I learned C.

After graduating, I landed my first job at a company that sold an inventory control system using a language no one had heard of before, called **Clarion**. Then, I decided to launch my first startup, called **Livenin**, which was an Uber Eats-like service before it arrived in my city. Unfortunately, it was before the pandemic and we failed.

Undeterred, I launched my second startup called **Blick**, which was an on-demand service platform, like plumbers, electricians, dentists, but we also failed.

Now, I am developing this template to help businesses and entrepreneurs launch their ideas quickly and help them succeed by testing first and inspiring them to launch their **AI agents**, **AI products**, and overall **AI solutions**.
